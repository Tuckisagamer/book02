# Chapter 11: Object Oriented Programming

## Section 1: What Is Object-Oriented Programming?

In earlier chapters, we’ve written code that followed a **procedural** model:
step-by-step instructions, usually working with simple data structures like
lists or dictionaries. Applications often need a different level
of structure - that’s where **object-oriented programming** (OOP) comes in.

OOP is a way of organizing and designing software by grouping data and the
functions that operate on that data into *objects*. These objects are based on
**classes**, which are like blueprints. Just like a blueprint for a house can be
used to build many houses, a class can be used to create many similar objects
(called **instances**).

### Why Use OOP?

Imagine you're building a simulation for a zoo. You could keep all the animals
in one list and try to remember which index represents which animal and what
each value means. That gets messy quickly.

Instead, you could create an `Animal` class that includes attributes like
`name`, `species`, and `age`, and methods like `feed()` or `make_sound()`. Then
each animal becomes its own object — easy to manage, easy to understand.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Object-oriented programming is especially powerful when your code deals with
> many similar "things" that each need to keep track of data *and* behavior —
> like users in an app, shapes in a drawing tool, or orders in an online store.

### Core OOP Concepts

* **Class**: A definition for what a type of object looks like (its structure
  and behavior).
* **Object (or Instance)**: A specific occurrence of a class.
* **Attributes**: Variables that store information inside an object.
* **Methods**: Functions that belong to an object and can act on its data.

In the next section, we’ll write our first class and see how to make our own
objects in Python.
