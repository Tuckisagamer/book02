## Section 3: Defining Models and Fields

Now that you’ve installed Peewee and created a database connection, it’s time
to define the tables your application will use. In Peewee, tables are defined
as Python classes called **models**, and each column in a table is represented
by a **field**.

This section will walk you through creating your first model and understanding
how fields work.

### What Is a Model?

A model in Peewee is a class that represents a table in your database. Each
instance of the class represents a row in the table, and each class attribute
defines a column.

Here's a basic example:

```python
from peewee import *

db = SqliteDatabase('airplanes.db')

class BaseModel(Model):
    class Meta:
        database = db

class Airplane(BaseModel):
    name = CharField()
    range_km = IntegerField()
    jet_engine = BooleanField(default=True)
```

In this example:

* `Airplane` is the model class.
* The fields `name`, `range_km`, and `jet_engine` define the columns.
* All models should inherit from a `BaseModel` that connects them to the
  database.

### Common Field Types

Peewee offers a variety of field types to match common data needs:

| Field Type        | Description                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `CharField`       | Stores short text like names or labels |
| `TextField`       | Stores long-form text                  |
| `IntegerField`    | Whole numbers                          |
| `FloatField`      | Decimal numbers                        |
| `BooleanField`    | True or False                          |
| `DateTimeField`   | Timestamps                             |
| `ForeignKeyField` | Links one model to another             |

You can also add options like `default=...`, `null=True`, or `unique=True` to
control how the database handles values.

```python
class Pilot(BaseModel):
    name = CharField()
    licensed = BooleanField(default=False)
    age = IntegerField(null=True)
```

### Primary Keys

By default, Peewee creates an auto-incrementing integer primary key called
`id`. You don’t need to define it unless you want something custom. If you do,
just include a field and set `primary_key=True`.

### Validating Data

Peewee doesn't perform automatic validation, but you can add logic to your
application to check that field values are reasonable before saving.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Use clear and consistent field names — this makes querying easier and helps
avoid bugs when your database grows more complex.

In the next section, you’ll learn how to **create and initialize these tables**
in your SQLite database so you can begin saving real data.
