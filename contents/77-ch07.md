## Section 7: Practice Project – Save and Load a Simple Dataset

You’ve now learned how to read and write *text files*, *CSV files*, and
*JSON files* — and how to handle file-related errors along the way.

In this section, you’ll combine all of those skills into a complete
*real-world-style project*: building a simple dataset manager that saves and
loads information using JSON.

---

### Project: Task Tracker

You’re going to create a *task tracker* that lets the user:

1. View existing tasks (loaded from a `.json` file)
2. Add a new task (with a description and a status)
3. Save the updated list back to the file

Each task will be stored as a dictionary, and all tasks will be stored in a
list.

---

### Data Structure

Here’s what your data might look like:

```python
[
  {"description": "Do laundry", "completed": False},
  {"description": "Finish Python project", "completed": True}
]
```

This will be stored in a file called `tasks.json`.

---

### Program Flow

You’ll write a script named `task_tracker.py` that:

1. Tries to load `tasks.json`. If it doesn’t exist, starts with an empty list.
2. Displays all existing tasks with their status.
3. Prompts the user to enter a new task.
4. Adds it to the list.
5. Saves the updated list back to the file.

---

### Example Program Code

```python
import json
import os

FILENAME = "tasks.json"

# Step 1: Load existing tasks or start fresh
if os.path.exists(FILENAME):
    with open(FILENAME, "r") as file:
        tasks = json.load(file)
else:
    tasks = []

# Step 2: Show existing tasks
print("\nCurrent Tasks:")
for index, task in enumerate(tasks, start=1):
    status = "ok" if task["completed"] else "xx"
    print(f"{index}. {task['description']} [{status}]")

# Step 3: Add a new task
new_task = input("\nEnter a new task: ").strip()
if new_task:
    tasks.append({"description": new_task, "completed": False})

# Step 4: Save back to file
with open(FILENAME, "w") as file:
    json.dump(tasks, file, indent=2)

print("Task saved successfully!")
```

---

### Optional Features to Try

* Add a menu: let the user choose to **add**, **view**, or **mark** tasks complete
* Automatically **mark tasks** as complete using user input
* Add a timestamp using the `datetime` module
* Allow the user to **delete** a task
* Add a search feature to find tasks by keyword

---

### Learning Goals

This project helps you practice:

* File handling using `open()` and context managers
* JSON serialization and deserialization
* Error handling with `os.path.exists()` or `try` / `except`
* Using lists and dictionaries together
* Building a multi-step, interactive command-line program

> **Helpful Hint:**
> You don’t need to make it perfect! The goal is to connect reading/writing JSON
