## Section 7: Debugging FastAPI Projects

Even experienced developers make mistakes — what separates them from beginners
is how they find and fix bugs. FastAPI offers clear error messages, built-in
tools, and helpful developer patterns to make debugging easier and faster.

In this section, you’ll learn how to:

* Understand common FastAPI error messages
* Use your browser and `/docs` to isolate bugs
* Apply Python debugging techniques to web apps

### 1. Use the Built-in Developer Server with `--reload`

Running FastAPI with `--reload` automatically restarts the server when you edit
your code and also shows detailed error messages.

```bash
python -m fastapi run main:app --reload
```

If there’s a syntax error, missing import, or typo in your route function, the
browser will display a traceback — a detailed report of what went wrong and
where.

### 2. Read the Error Message Closely

FastAPI (and Python) give stack traces that show:

* The filename and line number of the error
* The exact function or variable that failed
* A message explaining the issue (`NameError`, `TypeError`, etc.)

Don’t panic. Read the *last few lines* of the error message — that’s where the
true root cause usually appears.

### 3. Common Errors You’ll See

| Error Type         | What It Means                                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NameError`        | You tried to use a variable or function that doesn't exist |
| `SyntaxError`      | You made a typo (missing colon, parentheses, etc.)         |
| `TypeError`        | You passed the wrong kind of value to a function           |
| `ValueError`       | You passed a valid type, but it had the wrong format       |
| `TemplateNotFound` | Your template file is missing or in the wrong folder       |

### 4. Use `print()` to Trace Execution

You can temporarily add `print()` statements to your route functions to trace
what’s happening:

```python
@app.post("/submit")
def handle_form(name: str = Form(...)):
    print("Form submitted with name:", name)
    return {"message": f"Thanks, {name}"}
```

These printouts appear in your terminal while the server runs and can help
confirm whether certain lines are being reached.

### 5. Check the Swagger Docs at `/docs`

FastAPI’s interactive API documentation at `/docs` is a powerful debugging tool:

* It tells you what inputs each route expects
* It lets you test routes without writing HTML
* It shows error messages clearly and cleanly

### 6. Watch for Missing `request` in Template Context

One of the most common mistakes is forgetting to include the `request` in your
`TemplateResponse`:

```python
return templates.TemplateResponse("page.html", {"name": "Alice"})  # WRONG
```

Fix it like this:

```python
return templates.TemplateResponse("page.html", {"request": request, "name": "Alice"})  # CORRECT
```

Without the `request`, FastAPI’s templating system will raise an error, or
WORSE, fail silently.

### 7. Test Small Pieces First

If something isn’t working:

* Try testing the route in isolation
* Simplify the HTML template
* Temporarily remove dynamic data

Build back up from the smallest working version.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> You can temporarily change `return` values to simple strings to check if the
> route is being triggered. This helps narrow down whether the issue is in
> routing, form handling, or rendering.
