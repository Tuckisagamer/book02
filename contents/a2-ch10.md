## Section 2: Installing and Running FastAPI

Now that you understand what a web server does, it’s time to build one using
Python.

To do that, we'll use a helper call FastAPI.  FastAPI is a lightweight but
powerful framework for serving content and handling user input.

In this section, you'll:

* Set up a Python environment for web development
* Install FastAPI
* Create a minimal working FastAPI app
* Run it using FastAPI’s built-in development mode

### 1. Set Up a Project Folder

Open a terminal or command prompt and create a new directory for your project:

```bash
mkdir fastserver
cd fastserver
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment helps isolate project-specific dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Now you’re working in a clean space just for this project.

### 3. Install FastAPI

Use pip to install the latest version of FastAPI:

```bash
pip install -U pip # this updates pip in your virtualenv first
pip install fastapi[all]
```

> The `[all]` tag also installs the `httpx`, `jinja2`, and `python-multipart`
> packages, which are useful for form handling and HTML later in the course.

### 4. Create a Minimal FastAPI App

Create a file named `main.py` and add this code:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello, world!"}
```

This defines one route (`/`) that responds with a simple message.

### 5. Run the App Using FastAPI’s Dev Mode

FastAPI has a built in web service mode that's perfect for development.  You
would never want to use this in production on the web due to performance and
security reasons, but for our purposes, it's perfect.

```bash
python -m fastapi run main:app --reload
```

Explanation:

* `main:app` tells FastAPI where to find the application (`main.py`, object
  `app`)
* `--reload` watches for changes and restarts the server automatically
* This command uses FastAPI’s built-in development runner (available as of
  FastAPI v0.111.0)

Once it’s running, open your browser and go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

You should see:

```json
{"message": "Hello, world!"}
```

### 6. Explore the Built-In API Docs

One of the best features of FastAPI is the beautiful documentation that gets
built automatically.

* Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` to see Swagger UI
* Try clicking on the `/` route and testing it live
* This is a powerful tool for debugging and exploration

> **Helpful Hint:**
> If you ever get an error like "command not found," make sure your virtual
> environment is activated and you’ve installed FastAPI using
> `pip install fastapi[all]`.


### 7. Take a Breath

This section is dense with a lot of things happening under the hood.  Take a
moment and review what we did.

We created a Python virtual environment to give us a good place for us to
install dependencies and other libraries.

We installed an open source, third-party web framework called FastAPI.

We wrote our first web service with one handler.

We RAN our first web service and interacted with it in the browser.

We got documentation to go with it.

Whew.
