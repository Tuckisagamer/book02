## Section 2: Installing and Running a Bottle App

In this section, you'll set up your first Bottle web application and run it in
developer mode. This will give you a working web server that can respond to
requests and return HTML to the browser.

### Installing Bottle

To get started, you'll need to install the `bottle` package. Open your terminal
or command prompt and run:

```bash
pip install bottle
```

This installs the Bottle framework so you can import and use it in your Python
programs.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> It's a good idea to install Bottle inside a virtual environment so it doesn’t
affect your global Python installation.

### Your First Bottle App

Create a file called `app.py` and type the following:

```python
from bottle import route, run

@route('/')
def home():
    return "<h1>Welcome to My Bottle App</h1>"

run(host='localhost', port=8080, debug=True, reloader=True)
```

Then run the script:

```bash
python app.py
```

You should see output telling you the server is running. Open a browser and go
to:

```
http://localhost:8080/
```

You’ll see the HTML message “Welcome to My Bottle App”.

### What’s Going On?

* `@route('/')` tells Bottle to respond to requests to the home page (`/`).
* The `home()` function defines what content to return.
* `run()` starts the server on port 8080.
* The `debug=True` and `reloader=True` options help during development:

  * `debug=True` gives better error messages.
  * `reloader=True` restarts the server when your code changes.

### Try Adding Another Route

Add this below your existing route:

```python
@route('/about')
def about():
    return "<p>This is the about page.</p>"
```

Now visit `http://localhost:8080/about` in your browser. This is how Bottle
maps different URLs to different pieces of your Python code.

With your development server running and your first routes responding, you're
ready to build interactive pages. In the next section, you'll learn how to
serve static HTML content and lay the groundwork for dynamic templates.
