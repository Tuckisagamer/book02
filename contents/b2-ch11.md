## Section 2: Defining Your First Class

Let’s build our first class in Python from scratch. Think of a class as a design
template. When you create an instance of that class, it becomes an object — a
real thing you can use in your program.

Another way to think of a class versus an object is like this.  A class is a
design for something, it describes the shape of a thing. An object is actually
something created from that plan.

### Creating a Class

To define a class in Python, use the `class` keyword followed by the class name
(which should start with a capital letter by convention):

```python
class Pet:
    def __init__(self, name, species, age):
        self.name = name
        self.species = species
        self.age = age
```

This defines a class called `Pet` with three **attributes**: `name`, `species`,
and `age`.

The `__init__` method is a special function called a **constructor**. It runs
automatically when a new object is created.

### Understanding `self`

Each method inside a class takes `self` as its first parameter. This refers to
the individual object that is being created or used. So `self.name = name` means
“take the name provided and store it in this particular object’s `name`
attribute.”

### Creating an Object

Now that we’ve defined the `Pet` class, let’s create an instance:

```python
my_pet = Pet("Charlie", "dog", 3)
print(my_pet.name)     # Output: Charlie
print(my_pet.species)  # Output: dog
print(my_pet.age)      # Output: 3
```

Here, `my_pet` is an object, or **instance** of the `Pet` class. We’ve stored
specific values in the object, and we can access those values using dot
notation.

Next up, we’ll add **instance methods** so our pets can *do* things — like speak or celebrate a birthday.
