## Section 6: Serving Static Files Like CSS and Images

To make your Bottle applications look great and behave more like full-featured
websites, you’ll need to include **static files** - things like CSS for
styling, JavaScript for interactivity, and images for decoration or branding.

In this section, you’ll learn how to serve static files in Bottle and organize
your project structure to support them.

### What Are Static Files?

Static files are any non-Python assets that the browser needs to load alongside
the HTML:

* **CSS** – Controls fonts, colors, spacing, and layout
* **Images** – `.jpg`, `.png`, `.svg`, etc.
* **JavaScript** – Enables interactivity in the browser (not server-side Python)
* **Fonts** – Custom typefaces

These files are not processed by Bottle — they’re simply sent to the browser
as-is.

### Organizing Static Files

Create a `static` directory in your project folder:

```
project-folder/
├── app.py
├── views/
│   └── homepage.tpl
├── static/
│   ├── style.css
│   └── logo.png
```

### Serving Static Files with a Route

Add a route to your app that serves files from the `static/` directory:

```python
@route('/static/<filename>')
def serve_static(filename):
    return static_file(filename, root='./static')
```

Now, `http://localhost:8080/static/style.css` will load your stylesheet.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Make sure your filenames don’t include extra slashes or directories unless
> you add extra routing logic.

### Linking to Static Files in Templates

In your `.tpl` file, link to your static resources like this:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/style.css">
<img src="/static/logo.png" alt="Logo">
```

This allows the browser to load the CSS and images when rendering your page.

### Sample CSS File

Create a simple `static/style.css` file:

```css
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  margin: 40px;
}

h1 {
  color: darkblue;
}
```

### Full Example

In `views/home.tpl`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Styled Home</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to the Styled Bottle Page</h1>
  <p>This page is using an external stylesheet.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Now when you visit your home page route, it will look visually polished thanks
to the CSS.

### Summary

You’ve now learned how to:

* Organize static files in a project
* Write a route to serve static resources
* Link CSS and images in your HTML templates

with shared headers and footers to keep your pages consistent.
