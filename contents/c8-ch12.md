## Section 8: Updating and Deleting Records

In any application, data isn't static - users make changes, fix mistakes, or
remove outdated entries. Peewee makes updating and deleting records easy using
familiar Python syntax.

### Updating a Record

To update an object, retrieve it from the database, change its attributes, and
call `.save()`:

```python
plane = Airplane.get(Airplane.name == "F-16")
plane.range_km = 4500
plane.save()
```

This updates only the fields that have changed.

You can also use a bulk update:

```python
Airplane.update(range_km=6000).where(Airplane.name == "Boeing 747").execute()
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Bulk updates are faster for many rows but don’t trigger Python-side logic
> (like `.save()` might), so be careful with side effects or validation.

### Deleting a Record

To remove a single row:

```python
plane = Airplane.get(Airplane.name == "F-16")
plane.delete_instance()
```

To delete multiple records:

```python
Airplane.delete().where(Airplane.range_km < 1000).execute()
```

This will remove all airplanes with short range from the database.

### Cascading Deletes

If a model has foreign keys, you can choose what happens when a related record
is deleted. Peewee supports options like:

* `on_delete="CASCADE"` – automatically delete dependent records.
* `on_delete="SET NULL"` – remove the reference but keep the record.

Example:

```python
pilot = ForeignKeyField(Pilot, null=True, backref='airplanes',
   on_delete='SET NULL')
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Always double-check your deletion logic before running it — it's easy to
> accidentally wipe out more data than intended!

Now that you can modify and maintain your data, it’s time to learn how to
**use Peewee in a web context**. In the next section, you’ll integrate your
models with a Bottle.py app to serve dynamic pages based on your database
content.
