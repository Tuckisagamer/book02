## Section 3: Instance Methods and Behavior

Now that you've seen how to define a class and create an object, it’s time to
make our objects *do* things. In object-oriented programming, actions are
defined as **methods** inside the class.

### What Is an Instance Method?

An **instance method** is a function defined inside a class that operates on a
particular object (or "instance") of that class. You’ve already seen one -
`__init__()` - but you can define any number of your own.

Let’s give our `Pet` class some behavior:

```python
class Pet:
    def __init__(self, name, species, age):
        self.name = name
        self.species = species
        self.age = age

    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.name} the {self.species} says hello!")
```

Now when we create a `Pet` object, it can speak:

```python
my_pet = Pet("Luna", "cat", 2)
my_pet.speak()  # Output: Luna the cat says hello!

other_pet = Pet("Bob", "dog", 5)
other_pet.speak()  # Output: Bob the dog says hello!
```

### Adding Logic to Methods

Methods can contain logic that changes an object’s state. For example, let’s add
a birthday celebration method to our class definition:


```python
    def celebrate_birthday(self):
        self.age += 1
        print(f"Happy Birthday, {self.name}! You are now {self.age}.")
```

Now try:

```python
my_pet.celebrate_birthday()
```

Each method receives the object itself as the `self` parameter, so it has full
access to read or change its attributes.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> You don’t call instance methods like normal functions. Use
> `object.method_name()` — the object you’re calling it on is passed in
> automatically as `self`.
