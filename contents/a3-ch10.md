## Section 3: Defining Your First FastAPI Routes

A web server responds to **routes**, also called **endpoints**. These are
specific URL paths that your server listens for — such as `/`, `/about`, or
`/submit`. In FastAPI, you define these routes using decorators like
`@app.get()` and `@app.post()`.

In this section, you'll learn how to:

* Define multiple routes in your FastAPI app
* Respond to different paths and HTTP methods
* Return text or JSON from your server

### 1. The FastAPI App Object

All routes attach to the `app` object you created earlier:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()
```

The `app` is your running server. Now let’s give it more things to respond to.

### 2. Defining a Route with `@app.get()`

Here’s a route that responds to a browser visit at `/hello`:

```python
@app.get("/hello")
def say_hello():
    return {"message": "Hello there!"}
```

* `@app.get("/hello")` means “When a GET request is made to `/hello`, run the
  function below.”
* The function returns a dictionary, which FastAPI automatically converts to
  JSON.

Try adding this to your `main.py` and visiting:

```
http://localhost:8000/hello
```

### 3. Returning Plain Text

You can also return just plain text, like this:

```python
from fastapi.responses import PlainTextResponse

@app.get("/plaintext", response_class=PlainTextResponse)
def plain():
    return "Just some plain old text."
```

### 4. Adding Parameters to a Route

Routes can accept dynamic values using curly braces:

```python
@app.get("/greet/{name}")
def greet_user(name: str):
    return {"message": f"Hello, {name}!"}
```

Visiting `/greet/Dude` will return:

```json
{"message": "Hello, Dude!"}
```

FastAPI automatically converts types (like `int`, `str`, etc.) based on the
function signature.

### 5. Defining a POST Route

`POST` routes are commonly used for submitting data (e.g., from a form).

```python
from fastapi import Form

@app.post("/submit")
def handle_form(name: str = Form(...)):
    return {"message": f"You submitted: {name}"}
```

You’ll explore `POST` more deeply in the form-handling sections of this chapter,
but for now note that:

* Use `@app.post()` to respond to `POST` requests
* You can accept form data with the `Form()` helper

### 6. Check out the Docs Again

FastAPI’s built-in `/docs` page lets you:

* View all your routes
* Test them by submitting values directly
* See what the server returns

Visit:

```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

Your new route should be there.

Try your new `/greet/{name}` route and explore what FastAPI can do.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Every route must return something! A string, dictionary, or even HTML —
> FastAPI will try to figure out how to respond properly based on what you give
> it.
