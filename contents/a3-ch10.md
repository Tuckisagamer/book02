## Section 3: Serving Static HTML Pages

Now that you’ve created a basic Bottle server, it’s time to serve real web
pages — not just plain strings from Python functions. In this section, you’ll
learn how to send full HTML documents from your server to the browser.

### Returning Raw HTML

Your route functions can return full HTML pages by using multi-line strings:

```python
@route('/')
def home():
    return """
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>My Bottle Site</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Welcome to My Bottle Site</h1>
        <p>This is a simple static page.</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    """
```

When you visit `http://localhost:8080/`, the browser renders the HTML like any
regular website.

### Why Static Pages Matter

Static HTML pages are great for:

* **Landing pages** or other information that doesn't change
* **Testing layouts** before connecting to dynamic data
* **Understanding the separation** between backend code and frontend output

Later, you’ll replace some of these hardcoded pages with templates and
database-driven views. But for now, this is an important building block.

### Serving Real `.html` Files

For larger pages, it’s better to keep the HTML in its own file. Bottle can
serve any file in a directory you designate as a source for static content.

1. Create a folder named `views` in your project directory.
2. Inside it, create a file called `about.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>About</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>About This Site</h1>
    <p>This page is just static HTML loaded from a file.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

3. Then add this route to your `app.py`:

```python
from bottle import static_file

@route('/about')
def about():
    return static_file('about.html', root='./views')
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> The `static_file()` function tells Bottle to send the contents of a file on
> your disk as-is. It doesn’t process templates or insert dynamic values — just
> returns the raw content.

### File Organization Tip

It’s a good idea to keep your project tidy as it grows:

```
project-folder/
├── app.py
├── views/
│   └── about.html
├── static/
│   └── style.css
```

You’ll learn how to serve CSS and images from the `static/` folder in a future
section.

With this approach, you can build multi-page websites using Bottle and plain
HTML. In the next section, we’ll make your web pages dynamic by inserting data
from Python into HTML using Bottle’s built-in templating system.
