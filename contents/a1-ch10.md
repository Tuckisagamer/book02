# Chapter 10: Web Servers

## Section 1: What Is a Web Server?

Before you can build a web application, you need to understand how the *web
itself works*. When you visit a website, type in a URL, or click a link, you’re
not opening a file from your computer. Instead, you’re asking another computer —
called a **web server** — to send you something.

In this section, we’ll explore:

* What a web server does
* How browsers communicate with servers
* The basics of the HTTP protocol

### 1. The Role of a Web Server

A **web server** is a program that waits for requests from clients (like
browsers), figures out what was requested, and sends back a response.

It:

* Listens for incoming connections (usually on port 80 or 443)
* Accepts requests from clients (usually HTTP or HTTPS)
* Returns HTML, CSS, images, JavaScript, or JSON

In just a few sections, we will write our own Python program that will *be* a
web server. This allows you to respond to things like form submissions or API
calls.


### 2. How the Web Works: Request & Response

When you visit a website like `https://example.com`:

1. Your browser sends a **request** to the web server at that address.
2. The server processes the request.
3. The server sends back a **response** (usually HTML).
4. Your browser displays the result.

This process is based on a protocol called **HTTP** (HyperText Transfer
Protocol).

### 3. HTTP Methods: GET and POST

Two of the most common HTTP methods are:

| Method | What It Does                             |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | Requests data (like a web page or image) |
| `POST` | Sends data (like a form submission)      |

When you type a URL or click a link, your browser sends a `GET` request.
When you submit a form, it usually sends a `POST` request.

### 4. URL Paths and Routing

The web server decides how to respond to a request based on the **URL path**.

* `/` usually means the homepage
* `/about` might show an about page
* `/submit` might accept a form

Your job as a developer is to **set up those routes** so your server knows what
to do for each path.

### 5. Why Use Python for a Web Server?

Languages like Python let you:

* Respond dynamically to input
* Read and write from databases
* Send personalized responses
* Handle form input, user accounts, or API requests

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Think of your Python server like a *restaurant kitchen*. The browser is a
> waiter delivering orders (requests), and the server cooks up the right
> response — then sends it back to the table.
