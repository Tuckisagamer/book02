# Chapter 10: Web Servers

## Section 1: What Is a Web Server?

Before we begin building web applications, it's important to understand what a
web server actually is and how it fits into the broader ecosystem of the
internet. This section introduces the core concepts behind web servers, how
they handle requests, and why we use Bottle.py to build them.

### The Role of a Web Server

A **web server** is a program that listens for incoming requests from clients —
usually web browsers — and sends back responses, often in the form of HTML,
CSS, JavaScript, or data (like JSON). Think of it as a restaurant waiter:

* The client (browser) places an order (request)
* The server (waiter) brings the food (response)

The server may need to run logic, access a database, or perform other steps to
prepare the response.

### The Request–Response Cycle

Whenever you visit a website, your browser sends a **request** to a specific
URL. The server receives this request, processes it, and returns a
**response**. For example:

1. You visit `https://example.com/airplanes`
2. The browser sends a `GET /airplanes` request to the server
3. The server runs Python code to look up airplanes in a database
4. The server returns an HTML page listing those airplanes
5. The browser displays the page to you

This pattern of request and response is foundational to how the internet
works.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> The two most common types of requests you'll handle are `GET` (to retrieve
> data or a page) and `POST` (to submit data, like from a form).

### Static vs. Dynamic Content

* **Static content** is always the same — like an image file or a plain HTML
  page.
* **Dynamic content** is generated on the fly — like a personalized greeting,
  or a search result.

Bottle lets us build **dynamic** web pages using Python code. We can render
templates, respond to user input, and show different content depending on the
request.

### Why Use Bottle.py?

There are many Python web frameworks, but Bottle is:

* **Lightweight:** One file, no dependencies
* **Easy to learn:** Simple routing and templates
* **Powerful enough:** Can serve HTML, process forms, and return JSON
* **Great for beginners:** Ideal for learning how web apps work without much
  overhead

As you build with Bottle, you’ll get a deeper understanding of what web
frameworks do — and you’ll be writing real web apps by the end of this chapter.
