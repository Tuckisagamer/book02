## Section 5: Introduction to JSON

You’ve learned how to store data in plain text and CSV files. Now let’s level up
with a format that is perfect for saving **structured Python data** — like
dictionaries, lists, and nested combinations of both.

That format is called JSON.

---

### What Is JSON?

**JSON** stands for **JavaScript Object Notation**, but it’s used in almost
every programming language — not just JavaScript. It’s the most common way for
apps, APIs, and servers to send and receive structured data.

JSON looks almost exactly like a Python dictionary, with a few small
differences:

```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 15,
  "grades": [92, 85, 88]
}
```

In JSON:

* Keys and strings must use **double quotes**
* No trailing commas on the last element of an object or lists
* Only supports basic types: numbers, strings, booleans, null (like `None`),
  lists, and objects (like dictionaries)

---

### Python and JSON: A Perfect Match

Since JSON looks a lot like Python’s native types, converting between the two is
easy.

#### Convert Python → JSON string:

```python
import json

data = {"name": "Alice", "age": 15, "grades": [92, 85, 88]}
json_string = json.dumps(data)
print(json_string)
```

Output:

```
{"name": "Alice", "age": 15, "grades": [92, 85, 88]}
```

#### Convert JSON string → Python:

```python
python_data = json.loads(json_string)
print(python_data["grades"])
```

---

### Writing JSON to a File

You can save a Python object directly to a `.json` file:

```python
with open("student.json", "w") as file:
    json.dump(data, file)
```

This creates a file that looks like this:

```json
{"name": "Alice", "age": 15, "grades": [92, 85, 88]}
```

---

### Reading JSON from a File

To load that data back into a Python dictionary:

```python
with open("student.json", "r") as file:
    student = json.load(file)
    print(student["name"])  # Alice
```

You now have access to all the data as if you’d just typed it into your code.

---

### JSON Is Perfect For...

* Storing user profiles
* Saving app preferences
* Transferring structured data over the internet
* Saving collections of items (like to-do lists or inventory)

---

### Practice Challenge

1. Create a Python dictionary representing a student profile:

```python
{
  "name": "Jordan",
  "age": 16,
  "courses": ["math", "science", "history"],
  "active": True
}
```

2. Save the dictionary to a file called `profile.json`.
3. Write a separate script that loads the data from the file and prints:

   * The student’s name
   * Whether they are active
   * The number of courses they are enrolled in

> **Helpful Hint:**
> The `json` module only works with **basic Python types**. If you try to save a
> file, function, or class instance — it will fail without adding a custom
> encoder. Stick with dictionaries, lists, strings, numbers, booleans, and
> `None`.
