## Section 6: Real-World Use Cases for JSON

Now that you know how to save and load JSON in Python, you might be wondering:
*Where do we actually use this in the real world?* The answer is:
*pretty much everywhere.* JSON is one of the most important file formats in
modern software development.

### 1. Saving Data in Your Own Apps

Let’s say you're building a:

* To-do list app — Save tasks in a list of dictionaries, one for each task.
* Student profile manager — Save a dictionary of name, grade level, enrolled
  courses, and activity status.
* Simple game — Save high scores, levels completed, and player stats.

JSON gives you an easy way to write these structured objects to disk and load
them back in the next time the program runs.

```python
# Save game state
state = {"score": 4100, "level": 3, "items": ["sword", "potion", "key"]}
with open("savefile.json", "w") as file:
    json.dump(state, file)
```

### 2. Talking to Web APIs

When websites or apps talk to servers, they almost always send and receive
JSON. This is how your phone knows what the weather is, how your Music app
fetches playlists, and how your your addictive castle rush game knows you're not
in the top 10 globally even though you play it too much.

Here’s a simplified example of what an API might return:

```json
{
  "temperature": 72,
  "condition": "Partly Cloudy",
  "city": "Austin"
}
```

In later chapters, you’ll learn how to connect your Python code to web APIs
using JSON.

### 3. Configuration Files

Programs often need to load settings (like font size, dark mode, or user
preferences). These settings are commonly stored in a JSON file, often called
`config.json`.

```json
{
  "theme": "dark",
  "font_size": 16,
  "notifications": true
}
```

You could load this file at the start of your program:

```python
with open("config.json", "r") as file:
    config = json.load(file)

if config["theme"] == "dark":
    print("Applying dark mode...")
```

This makes your program feel personalized and professional.

### 4. Exporting and Importing Data

Need to send your data to someone else? JSON is often used as an
**export format**:

- Save a `.json` file to transfer data between apps
- Upload a `.json` file to restore settings
- Import/export data for spreadsheets, mobile apps, or even websites

Since JSON is human-readable, you can open it in a text editor and inspect it —
unlike binary formats.

---

### Summary

JSON is used:

* To *store structured data* locally (like player stats or tasks)
* To *exchange data* between apps (via APIs)
* To *save settings* (config files)
* To *import/export* collections of structured data

Python makes it easy to use, and you’ll rely on it more and more as you build
web apps and services.

### Practice Challenge

Create a program called `habit_tracker.py` that:

1. Asks the user to enter the habit they’re tracking (e.g., “Read”, “Workout”)
2. Stores the habit name and the current date in a dictionary. Hint - use
   datetime.now().isoformat() to get a date as a string.
3. Appends it to a list, and saves it as a JSON file
4. When the program starts, it checks for and loads any existing file first, so
   the user can track multiple entries over time
