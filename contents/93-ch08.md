## Section 3: Using INNER JOIN to Combine Data

An **INNER JOIN** is the most common type of join in SQL. It returns only the
rows that have matching values in both tables. If there’s no match, the row is
left out.

In this section, you’ll learn how to use `INNER JOIN` to combine data across
tables, write multi-table queries, and filter joined results for practical
insights.

### 1. The Logic Behind INNER JOIN

Imagine two tables:

**students**

| id | name       |
| -- | ---------- |
| 1  | Emma Davis |
| 2  | Josh Lee   |
| 3  | Maya Patel |

**enrollments**

| student_id | course_id |
| ---------- | --------- |
| 1          | 101       |
| 2          | 101       |
| 2          | 102       |

When you use an `INNER JOIN`, only students with a matching `student_id` in
`enrollments` will appear in the result. Student #3 (Maya) won’t show up because
she’s not enrolled in any course yet.

### 2. Writing an INNER JOIN Query

```sql
SELECT students.name, enrollments.course_id
FROM students
INNER JOIN enrollments
  ON students.id = enrollments.student_id;
```

This query:

* Starts with the `students` table
* Joins it with the `enrollments` table
* Matches rows where `students.id = enrollments.student_id`
* Selects only the `name` and `course_id` columns

**Result:**

| name       | course_id |
| ---------- | --------- |
| Emma Davis | 101       |
| Josh Lee   | 101       |
| Josh Lee   | 102       |

### 3. Joining Three Tables

Joins aren’t limited to two tables. You can link as many tables as needed — just
keep chaining the `JOIN` statements.

Let’s bring in a third table: `courses`.

**courses**

| id  | title       |
| --- | ----------- |
| 101 | Biology 101 |
| 102 | Chemistry 1 |
| 103 | Algebra I   |

```sql
SELECT students.name, courses.title
FROM students
JOIN enrollments ON students.id = enrollments.student_id
JOIN courses ON enrollments.course_id = courses.id;
```

This query gives you a human-readable list of **which students are taking which courses**.

### 4. Filtering Joined Data

You can still use `WHERE` with joins to narrow down results. For example:

```sql
SELECT students.name, courses.title
FROM students
JOIN enrollments ON students.id = enrollments.student_id
JOIN courses ON enrollments.course_id = courses.id
WHERE courses.title = 'Biology 101';
```

This query filters the results to **only students enrolled in Biology 101**.

### 5. Practical Use Cases for INNER JOIN

* See which students are enrolled in which courses
* Get a list of orders with their customers (in a store database)
* Match employees to departments, or books to authors

> **Helpful Hint:**
> `INNER JOIN` is all about **overlap**. It only returns rows that have matching
> values in both tables. If you want to see *all* entries from one table, even
> when there’s no match, you’ll need a different kind of join — which we’ll
> cover next.
