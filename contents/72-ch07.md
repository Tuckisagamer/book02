## Section 2: Reading and Writing Plain Text Files

Now that you know *why* storing data in files is important, let’s learn *how* to
do it. We’ll start with **plain text files** — the simplest kind. You can open
these with any text editor (like Notepad or VS Code), and your Python program
can read from or write to them.

### Opening a File

In Python, you use the `open()` function to access a file. It takes two main
arguments:

1. **filename** - what the file will be named on storage
2. **mode** — what you want to do with the file (write, read, append)

Example:

```python
file = open("data.txt", "w")  # "w" means write mode
```

But this isn’t the best way to manage files. A better and safer option is using
a `with` statement:

```python
with open("data.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, file!")
```

When the block finishes, Python *automatically closes the file*. This is
important — always closing files prevents errors and bugs later.

---

### Writing to a File

Use `.write()` to put text in a file:

```python
with open("notes.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Python is fun!\n")
    file.write("Let's learn how to store things.\n")
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> `"w"` mode erases the file each time. If you want to *add* to the file instead, use `"a"` (append mode).

```python
with open("notes.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("Adding another line!\n")
```

---

### Reading from a File

You can open a file in `"r"` mode to **read** it:

```python
with open("notes.txt", "r") as file:
    contents = file.read()
    print(contents)
```

This prints the whole file as one long string. Want to break it into lines?

```python
with open("notes.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    for line in lines:
        print("Line:", line.strip())
```

* `.read()` gives you everything at once
* `.readlines()` gives you a list of lines
* `.strip()` removes the newline `\n` at the end of each line

---

### What Happens If the File Doesn’t Exist?

If you try to open a file in `"r"` (read) mode that doesn’t exist, Python will throw an error:

```python
with open("missing.txt", "r") as file:
    text = file.read()  # This crashes if the file doesn't exist!
```

You’ll learn how to handle these kinds of errors in the next section using `try` / `except`.

### Summary: File Modes

| Mode  | Description                          |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ |
| `"r"` | Read (file must already exist)       |
| `"w"` | Write (creates or erases file)       |
| `"a"` | Append (adds to the end of the file) |

### Practice Exercise

Create a file named `journal.txt` and write three lines into it. Then, write a second program that reads the file and prints each line with a line number:

```text
Line 1: [first line]
Line 2: [second line]
Line 3: [third line]
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Use `enumerate()` when looping through lines to track the line numbers.

Next up: you’ll learn how to handle **file errors** gracefully using `try` / `except` blocks.
