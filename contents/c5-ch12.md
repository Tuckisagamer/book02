## Section 5: Inserting and Saving Data

Now that your tables are defined and created, it's time to insert actual data
into them. Peewee makes this process intuitive by allowing you to work directly
with Python objects rather than raw SQL queries.

### Creating and Saving a Single Record

To add a new row to your database, you instantiate a model and call `.save()`:

```python
from models import Airplane

plane = Airplane(name="Cessna 172", range_km=1285)
plane.save()
```

When you call `.save()`, Peewee inserts the new record into the `airplane`
table. If your model includes an auto-incrementing `id` field, it will
automatically be generated and assigned.

### Using `.create()` for Shortcuts

Peewee also provides a `.create()` method that both instantiates and saves the
object in one step:

```python
Airplane.create(name="F-22 Raptor", range_km=2963, jet_engine=True)
```

This is useful for quick inserts when you don't need to modify or inspect the
object afterward.

### Default Values

If your model defines a field with a `default=...`, you don’t need to specify
it when inserting:

```python
# jet_engine defaults to True, so we can omit it
Airplane.create(name="Glider", range_km=500)
```

The field will automatically be filled with the default value.

### Bulk Inserts

To insert multiple records at once, use a list of dictionaries with
`.insert_many()`:

```python
planes = [
    {"name": "Boeing 747", "range_km": 13850},
    {"name": "Airbus A380", "range_km": 15700},
]
Airplane.insert_many(planes).execute()
```

Bulk inserts are more efficient than inserting records one at a time.

### Error Handling and Validation

Peewee doesn’t enforce validation rules by default, so it's a good practice to
check data before saving. For example, you might write a function to validate
that `range_km` is a positive number before saving the model.

You can also wrap inserts in `try`/`except` blocks to handle unexpected errors:

```python
try:
    Airplane.create(name="F-35", range_km=-1000)  # Invalid data
except Exception as e:
    print("Failed to save airplane:", e)
```

In the next section, we’ll dive into how to **query the database** to retrieve
saved information, filter data, and work with query results.
