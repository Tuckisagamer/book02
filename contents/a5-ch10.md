## Section 5: Handling Form Input in Bottle

Web applications become truly interactive when they accept **user input**. In
this section, you'll learn how to create HTML forms and receive submitted data
on the server using Bottle. This is how users can register, search, post
content, or interact with your app in meaningful ways.

### Creating a Simple HTML Form

Let’s start by writing a form in your HTML. Create a file called `form.html` in
the `views/` directory:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Favorite Plane</title></head>
<body>
  <h1>Submit Your Favorite Airplane</h1>
  <form action="/submit" method="POST">
    <label for="plane">Airplane Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="plane" name="plane" required>
    <br>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```

### Displaying the Form

Now update your app to serve the form:

```python
@route('/form')
def form():
    return static_file('form.html', root='./views')
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080/form` to view the form in the browser.

### Receiving Form Data with POST

When the user submits the form, the browser sends the data to your server as a
`POST` request. You can read the submitted values using Bottle’s
`request.forms` object:

```python
from bottle import request

@route('/submit', method='POST')
def submit():
    plane = request.forms.get('plane')
    return f"You submitted: {plane}"
```

This route handles the form submission and displays the result back to the
user.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> The `method='POST'` parameter tells Bottle to only respond to form
> submissions. Use `method='GET'` for simple links or queries, and `POST` for
> actions like submitting a form.

### A Note on GET vs POST

| GET                          | POST                             |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Data in URL (e.g., `?q=F16`) | Data in request body (not shown) |
| Good for searches            | Good for confidential data       |
| Can be bookmarked            | Cannot be bookmarked             |

Most form submissions that **change data** (create accounts, post comments,
etc.) should use `POST`.

### Showing the Submitted Value in a Template

To make your response more styled and structured, you can use a template
instead of a plain string:

```python
@route('/submit', method='POST')
def submit():
    plane = request.forms.get('plane')
    return template('confirmation', plane=plane)
```

Template `views/confirmation.tpl`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Thank You</title></head>
<body>
  <h1>Thank You!</h1>
  <p>You submitted: <strong>{{ plane }}</strong></p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Summary

You’ve now created your first interactive form:

* Built a form using HTML
* Served it with Bottle
* Accepted user input via `POST`
* Displayed the result dynamically

In the next section, you’ll learn how to serve CSS and static files (like
images or JavaScript) alongside your HTML to style and enrich your web pages.
