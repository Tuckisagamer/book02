## Section 4: Class vs Instance Variables

In Python, classes can contain two kinds of variables: **instance variables**
and **class variables**. Understanding the difference helps you control whether
data belongs to a *single object* or is *shared across all objects*.

### Instance Variables

Instance variables are the ones you've already seen — stored on each object and
unique to that object. They’re created inside the `__init__` method (or
elsewhere using `self.`), and they vary from one instance to the next.

Remember the Pet class from earlier? Let's define one specifically for dogs.

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name       # instance variable
        self.breed = breed     # instance variable
```

Each dog will have its own `name` and `breed`.

### Class Variables

A **class variable** is shared across all instances of the class. It is defined
*outside* any method, directly in the class body.

Example:

```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canis familiaris"  # class variable

    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
```

All `Dog` objects will share the same `species` unless you override it.

```python
dog1 = Dog("Rover", "Labrador")
dog2 = Dog("Fido", "Poodle")

print(dog1.species)  # Canis familiaris
print(dog2.species)  # Canis familiaris
```

If you *change* `species` on the class itself, it affects all instances:

```python
Dog.species = "Doggo sapiens"
print(dog1.species)  # Doggo sapiens
```

But if you assign to `dog1.species`, it creates a new **instance** variable,
leaving the class variable unchanged for others.

### When to Use Each

* Use **instance variables** for data specific to each object (like `name`,
  `age`, or `color`)
* Use **class variables** for default values or shared info (like `species`, a
  version number, or counters)

> **Helpful Hint:**
> If every object gets the same value, start with a class variable. If that
> value later needs to vary, you can switch to an instance variable without
> breaking the rest of your code.
