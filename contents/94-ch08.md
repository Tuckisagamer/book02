## Section 4: LEFT JOIN for Incomplete or Optional Relationships

In real-world data, it's common for some records in one table to not have a
match in another. For example:

* A student who hasn’t enrolled in any courses yet
* A product that has never been purchased
* A blog post without any comments

This is where `LEFT JOIN` becomes useful.

### 1. What Does LEFT JOIN Do?

A **LEFT JOIN** returns:

* **All rows from the left table**
* **Matching rows from the right table** (if any)
* If there is **no match**, the right side will return **NULL**

```sql
SELECT students.name, enrollments.course_id
FROM students
LEFT JOIN enrollments ON students.id = enrollments.student_id;
```

This includes **all students**, even if they aren’t enrolled in any course.

---

### 2. Why LEFT JOIN Is Useful

You can use `LEFT JOIN` to:

* Find items with no connection to another table
* Build inclusive reports (e.g., *everyone, even those with 0 participation*)
* Identify “missing” relationships or incomplete data

### 3. Example Result

Assuming Maya isn’t enrolled in any course:

**students**

| id | name       |
| -- | ---------- |
| 1  | Emma Davis |
| 2  | Josh Lee   |
| 3  | Maya Patel |

**enrollments**

| student_id | course_id |
| ---------- | --------- |
| 1          | 101       |
| 2          | 101       |
| 2          | 102       |

With a `LEFT JOIN`:

| name       | course_id |
| ---------- | --------- |
| Emma Davis | 101       |
| Josh Lee   | 101       |
| Josh Lee   | 102       |
| Maya Patel | NULL      |

Maya is still included, even though she has no match in `enrollments`.

### 4. Filtering for Missing Data

If you specifically want to *find records with no match*, filter using `IS
NULL`:

```sql
SELECT students.name
FROM students
LEFT JOIN enrollments ON students.id = enrollments.student_id
WHERE enrollments.course_id IS NULL;
```

This query lists students who are **not enrolled in any course**.

### 5. LEFT vs INNER JOIN

| Feature              | INNER JOIN | LEFT JOIN                 |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| Matches only         | Yes        | No                        |
| Shows unmatched rows | No         | Yes, from the left table  |
| Includes NULLs       | No         | Yes, in unmatched columns |

Use **INNER JOIN** when you want **only matches**, and **LEFT JOIN** when you
want **everything from one table**, regardless of matches.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> `LEFT JOIN` is like asking, “Tell me everything from **Table A**, and fill in
> what you can from **Table B** — even if there’s nothing there.”
