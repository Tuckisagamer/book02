## Section 2: Introduction to SQL Joins

So far, you've worked with single SQL tables — filtering, selecting, and sorting
data from just one table at a time. But relational databases are powerful
because they let us *combine* data across multiple tables using **joins**.

A `JOIN` lets you answer questions that can't be answered from one table alone:

* What are the names of all students enrolled in Biology 101?
* Who teaches each student’s classes?
* How many students are enrolled in each course?

This section introduces the concept of joins and explains the basic types you’ll
use.

### 1. What Is a JOIN?

A **join** combines data from two (or more) tables
*based on a related column**. Usually, this means matching a **foreign key** in
one table to a **primary key** in another.

For example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM students
JOIN enrollments ON students.id = enrollments.student_id;
```

This query joins the `students` table to the `enrollments` table where their IDs
match — pulling in columns from both tables into one combined result.

### 2. Visualizing a JOIN

Imagine the following:

**students**

| id | name       |
| -- | ---------- |
| 1  | Emma Davis |
| 2  | Josh Lee   |

**enrollments**

| student_id | course_id |
| ---------- | --------- |
| 1          | 101       |
| 2          | 101       |
| 2          | 102       |

A join pulls together the matching student rows:

| id | name       | student_id | course_id |
| -- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- |
| 1  | Emma Davis | 1          | 101       |
| 2  | Josh Lee   | 2          | 101       |
| 2  | Josh Lee   | 2          | 102       |

You can now see *who is enrolled in which course* - something neither table
alone could tell you.

### 3. Types of SQL Joins (Overview)

There are a few kinds of joins you’ll encounter:

| Type           | What It Does                                                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **INNER JOIN** | Returns only rows with matches in both tables                        |
| **LEFT JOIN**  | Returns all rows from the left table, even if there’s no match       |
| RIGHT JOIN     | Like LEFT JOIN but reversed (less common in beginner use)            |
| FULL JOIN      | Combines all rows from both tables (rarely needed in simple queries) |

We'll focus on the most useful types for now: **INNER JOIN** and **LEFT JOIN**.

### 4. JOIN Syntax Basics

The general format is:

```sql
SELECT table1.column, table2.column
FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON table1.key = table2.key;
```

* `JOIN` decides *which tables to combine*
* `ON` tells SQL *how to match the rows*

Always be clear about *which columns you’re joining on*, especially if they
have the same names in both tables.

### 5. Naming Your Columns

In joins, it’s helpful to *qualify column names* using the table name or an
alias:

```sql
SELECT students.name, enrollments.course_id
FROM students
JOIN enrollments ON students.id = enrollments.student_id;
```

This helps avoid confusion if both tables have a column named `id`.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Joins don’t modify the data — they only *query* across relationships. Think of
> them as temporary connections that let you look across your tables.

to combine real-world datasets to answer meaningful questions.
