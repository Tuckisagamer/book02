## Section 2: Installing and Setting Up Peewee

To start working with Peewee in your Python projects, you'll need to install the
library, create a database file, and write some boilerplate code to connect your
models to that database. This section will guide you through the setup process.

### Installing Peewee

You can install the Peewee ORM using pip:

```bash
pip install peewee
```

If you're working inside a virtual environment (which is recommended), make sure
it's activated first. Once installed, you can import Peewee classes like
`Model`, `CharField`, and `SqliteDatabase` in your code.

### Creating a SQLite Database

SQLite is a lightweight, file-based database that doesn’t require a separate
server. You can create a new database file simply by connecting to a filename
that doesn’t exist yet:

```python
from peewee import SqliteDatabase

db = SqliteDatabase('my_database.db')
```

This line creates a new file called `my_database.db` in your project folder if
it doesn't already exist. This file will hold your entire database.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> SQLite is perfect for development and small projects, but for production
> systems, you'll eventually want to use a more powerful database engine like
> PostgreSQL or MySQL.

### Project Folder Structure

Here’s a suggested folder structure for a basic Peewee project:

```
my_project/
│
├── app.py             # Main application logic
├── models.py          # Your Peewee model classes
├── my_database.db     # SQLite database file
└── templates/         # (Optional) HTML templates for web use
```

Keeping models in a separate `models.py` file makes it easier to reuse them
across different parts of your application.

### Creating a Database Connection

Once you've declared a database, you'll associate it with your models and call
`.connect()` and `.close()` to manage the connection:

```python
db.connect()
# Run your queries or app logic here
db.close()
```

Later in the chapter, you’ll see how to structure this automatically when using
web frameworks like Bottle.
