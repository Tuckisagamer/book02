## Computing Pioneer: Grace Hopper

> “The most dangerous phrase in the language is: ‘We’ve always done it this way.’”
— **Grace Hopper**, computer scientist and U.S. Navy rear admiral

Grace Brewster Murray Hopper (1906–1992) was a trailblazer in computer
programming, known for her brilliant mix of technical innovation and practical
thinking. During World War II, she worked on the *Harvard Mark I*, one of the
earliest programmable computers. Later, she helped create one of the first
compilers — a program that translates human-readable code into machine
instructions — paving the way for modern programming languages.

Hopper was also a driving force behind the development of *COBOL (Common
Business-Oriented Language)*, which made it possible for people outside of
computer science to write software for business and government systems. Her
vision of making programming accessible and understandable shaped the very idea
of high-level languages — the kind of readable, logical code we still use today
in Python, SQL, and beyond.

Grace Hopper’s work reminds us that data is most powerful when we can understand
and communicate it. Just as she connected human thought to machine logic, this
chapter connects separate pieces of data into meaningful relationships through
*SQL joins*.
